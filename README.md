# React + Vite
🚀 FakeStoreApp is a modern and responsive E-Commerce Web Application built using React.js ⚛️ and powered by the Fake Store API 🛍️.

✨ I’ve implemented an advanced #SearchFeature 🔍 that lets users quickly find products by name or category. The #CartSystem 🛒 is managed efficiently with #ReduxToolkit ⚙️, enabling users to add, remove, and update product quantities ➕➖ while automatically calculating the #TotalPrice 💰.

🧭 The app uses #ReactRouter 🌐 for smooth navigation between pages, ensuring a clean and intuitive user experience 👥. I also added a #FilterMenu 🎛️, allowing users to browse products based on specific categories for better accessibility.

💡 This project highlights my skills in #FrontendDevelopment, #StateManagement, and #APIIntegration, demonstrating how to build a fully functional and dynamic shopping experience 💻🔥.
